RECAP:
OOP(Object Oriented Programming) - A way of writing code
    - Classes and objects are the basic parts of this method
    - Fields and Methods can be defined anywhere in the class
Why should we learn OOP?
    - Simplifies the development of programs
    - Makes it easy to manage and maintain large programs
    - OOP is built around objects, classes and many other things which can help us
        translate real life objects into computers
How to write programs using OOP
    1) Create classes. Inside the classes, define properties/fields/attributes to show what object looks like, in real life
    2) Create methods/behaviors/functions to define how that thing works, in real life
Note:
    - OOP is also supported in many other programming languages like C#, PHP, Python, Javascript
    - Other than OOP, we also have different paradigm or ways of writing code:
        - Functional Programming & Procedural Programming
    - In java, its convention to call them FIELDS and METHODS
How do we create a class and its object:
    class Human{
    String name; //attributes, properties, fields
    int age;
    double weight;
    char gender;

    //methods, functions, behaviors
    void walk(){
    System.out.println("I can walk");
    }

    public static void main(String [] args){

    Human sameer = new Human();
    sameer.name = "Sameer";
    sameer.age = 20;
    sameer.weight = 130;
    sameer.gender = 'M';
    sameer.walk();
    }
