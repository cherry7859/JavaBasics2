Access Modifiers:
    keywords in Java that help us control the access of
    classes, variables, methods and other blocks of code.
    There are 4 access levels: private, default(not a keyword), protected and public

Private:
    When we use private keyword with a method or field, it is only accessible inside that class
    The most restrictive access modifier
Default:
    Acts like Public - When we don't use any access modifier keyword with a field or a method, then access default is applied by Java
    which means we can access this variable in any class within the package
Protected:
    We can access the method or variable inside the other classes which are inside the same package
    + inside the classes which are in different packages as well, but they have relationship with the original class
Public:
    Can use the field or method anywhere inside the same project

To access the method or field from another package: import "package name".class;
java.lang package: automatically imports some variables, like String
java.util package: have to import, like Scanner
