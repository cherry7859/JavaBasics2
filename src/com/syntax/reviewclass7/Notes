Types of Variables in Java:
    We have three types of variables in 1) local 2) instance 3)static
Local Variables:
    Declared inside a block of code
    Upside: They occupy the memory for shortest period of time
    Downside: They can't be access outside that block in which they are declared
Instance Variables:
    Declared inside a class but outside a block of code
    Upside: Can be accessed in all the methods of class. Can have different values for eah instance of that class
Static Variables:
    Adefined outside a block of code with static keyword
    Upside: 1)Only reserve a single memory location for all the instances of a class
            2)They can be accessed by just writing the name of the class and variable name
    Downside:
            Occupy the memory for longest period of time, they always store only one value for all the objects of that class

Real Life Use:
    Most of the time you will be storing constant values in static variables.
    Static is also used heavily with methods that don't involve instance variables

Access Modifiers:
    There are 3 access modifier keywords(private, protected, public) and four access levels(<-- + default) in java
    Rules: Access modifiers can only be used with instance and static members of a class (fields and methods)
    Private:
        When we use private with any method or variable we can only access that method or variable in that class
    Real Life Use:
        99% of time instance fields are always private
        99% of time instance and static methods are public
