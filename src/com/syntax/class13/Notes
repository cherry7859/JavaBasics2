String Class:
 - Is used to store and manipulate character based data like:
    - numbers, alphabets, and special characters
Breakdown: String str = new String("Hold your horses for IntelliJ");
String ==> Datatype/Class
str ==> variable name/object instance
= ==> assignment operator
new ==> used to create objects
String(); ==> Constructor; Like a method, contains some java statements which are executed when object of this class is created

String Vs. StringBuilder

String is immutable, once created cannot be modified
   - Slow and consumes more memory when you concatenate many Strings b/c every time creates a new instance
   - Use when we need to save memory, don't care about time

StringBuilder is mutable, can be modified
    - Consumes less memory when concat Strings
    - This class in java is same as String class, except can be modified
    - Use when there is a necessity to make a lot of modifications to String
    - Use when we want the fastest variable declaration, but not about memory used
