What is a method:
    Block of code(group of java statements). It defines the behavior of a class

Why do we use methods:
    1)It helps us remove the duplicate code from out application.
    We just create a method and everytime we need that logic we just call the method
    that contains that logic.
    2) It also allows to write code in the form of modules which makes
    the development of large applications easier

How to use Methods:
    1)Create the method inside a class
    2)Create the object of that class
    3)Call the method by writing the objectName.methodName

class Calculator {

void add(int a, int b){
System.out.println(a+b)
}

public static void main(String[] args) {

Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
calculator.add(10,20);
}
}
Rules to create and use methods:
void add(int a, int b) {
System.out.println(a+b);
}
void => must have a return type:void or the specific data type
    when we write a void, we can't assign a method call to a variable
add => next we write the name of the method, which can be anything
() => can specify the parameters here, can use any datatype inside

{
System.out.println(a+b)
} => body of the method that contains the java statements

add (int a, int b) = This part with the name of the method and its parameter is called signature of a method
void add (int a, int b) => header of the method
