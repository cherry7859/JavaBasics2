What is Inheritance:
    A mechanism in java through which one class acquires properties from another class
    One of the main four pillars of OOPS
Why we should use Inheritance:
    1) Helps reduce the amount of code we have to write
    2) It is more efficient
    3) Saves memory
How to use Inheritance:
    "extends" keyword followed name of Parent class from which to inherit the code
class Parent{
String name = "Newton";
String eyeColor = "brown";
}
class Child extends Parent{

public void printInfo(){
System.out.println(name+" "+eyeColor);
}
}

Types of Inheritance:
    Different languages support different types of inheritances, but 5 are very common:
    1) Single - single parent, single child
    2) Multilevel - one parent, one child, multiple intermediate(down the chain)
    3) Hierarchical - one parent, multiple children
    4) Multiple - multiple parent, one child (not used in java for classes)
    5) Hybrid
