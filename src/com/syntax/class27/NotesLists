List:
    - The first interface we are discussing from the collections framework
    - We can store duplicate data
    - Insertion order is maintained
ArrayList:
    - don't have to provide size during initialization, but it will move faster if you do
linkedListClass:
    - Joining in a minute
Difference btwn ArrayList and LinkedList
    - ArrayList (More reading, less writing):
        - Retrieval(get operation) of elements is super fast
            - b/c all data store in single line(consecutive data)
        - Manipulating(adding and deleting) elements is expensive
    - LinkedList (More writing, less reading):
        - beneficial when have to insert data randomly, not at last index
        - Retrieval is super slow if the list is big
