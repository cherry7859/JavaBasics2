What is a List:
    - an interface inside the collections framework, which have below properties
    1) Insertion order is maintained
    2) Can store duplicate data
List is implemented by many classes, but we're focusing on ArrayList and LinkedList:
    1) ArrayList: Use when required to read the data a lot (Accessing phone contacts)
    2) LinkedList: Most of our operations will be writing fata in btwn or beginning of list (Adding phone contacts)
Iterator:
    - an interface that has three methods hasNext() next() and remove().
    - when we try to modify the size of a list using wimple loop, it can cause error

Set:
    - interface inside collections framework
    - Duplicates are not allowed
    - no "get" method b/c not index based data structure
    - 3 Types:
        1) HashSet
            - No insertion order is maintained
            - retrieval fastest of all
        2) LinkedHashSet
            - insertion order is maintained
            - retrieval of elements will be super slow
            - insertion speed slower than Hashset
        3)TreeSet
            - elements will always be in sorted form
            - insertion speed is slowest of all
            - retrieval better than LinkedList but slower than Hashset
Map:
    - Interface in java that allows us to store key value pairs
    - we cannot have duplicate keys, but can have duplicate values
    - 3 types we are discussing:
        1) HashMap
            - Fastest for insertion and retrieval of elements
            - No insertion order
        2)LinkedHashMap
            - Insertion order maintained
            - Retrieval is slowest
        3)TreeMap
            - Data will be stored in the sorted form based on key values
            - Insertion is slowest
