Super Keyword:
    Used to refer to the parent class object
Why should we learn Super Keyword:
    1) If we have same name variable or method in the super/parent/base class, then
        we can use super keyword to refer to parent class variable or method
    2)  We can also call the super class constructor with super();
How to use Super Keyword:
    1) We can use super.method or field to call the method or access the field of super class
    2) super(); to call the super class constructor

Rules:
    1) We can only access the immediate parent class constructor or field or method with the help of super keyword
    2) We can only use super() inside a constructor
    3) If we have a user created constructor in the parent class, we must have a matching parameter
        constructor in the subclass ( for at least one of the user created constructors)
    4) super() should be the first line inside a constructor
