Constructor:
    A block of code that is used to create/construct objects
Why we should use Constructors:
    Help us initialize objects in cleaner and more readable way
    They are better than methods b/c they are called automatically when we create an object
    Most of the time, fields are private. And b/c of this, we can't access them outside of the class
        in which they are declared and can't initialize them
How to use Constructor:
    We create them by writing a block of code that has same name as class name
    When we create the object of that class, the constructor is called automatically
Rules:
    1)Don't have return types, not even void
    2)Should have same name as class name
    3)Can have access modifiers, like private public and protected
    4)Can't have non-access modifiers like static final synchronized
    5)Default constructor is provided by java if we don't write one
    6)When we create the object of a class, then a constructor is called.
        For example if the the class name is Dog: Dog dog1 = new Dog();
    7) We can create multiple constructors(w/different # of parameters)
        to give other user flexibility to use call chosen variables
    8)We can call the constructor by using this keywords with parenthesis.
    this() we can pass parameters and java will decide based on these parameters which constructor to call
    "this" keyword:
        Whenever we have a local and instance variable with the same name, this keyword can help sus resolve the conflict
    class Human{
    String name = "sleeping Zombi";

    void printName(){
    String name = "wake up Zombi";

    System.out.println(this.name); //Prints the instance variable
    }
    }
