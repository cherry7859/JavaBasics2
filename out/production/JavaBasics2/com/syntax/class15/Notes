What is a method:
    Block of code(group of java statements). It defines the behavior of a class

Why do we use methods:
    1)It helps us remove the duplicate code from out application.
    We just create a method and everytime we need that logic we just call the method
    that contains that logic.
    2) It also allows to write code in the form of modules which makes
    the development of large applications easier

How to use Methods:
    1)Create the method inside a class
    2)Create the object of that class
    3)Call the method by writing the objectName.methodName

class Calculator {

void add(int a, int b){
System.out.println(a+b)
}

public static void main(String[] args) {

Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
calculator.add(10,20);
}
}
Rules to create and use methods:
void add(int a, int b) {
System.out.println(a+b);
}
void => must have a return type:void or the specific data type
    when we write a void, we can't assign a method call to a variable
add => next we write the name of the method, which can be anything
() => can specify the parameters here, can use any datatype inside

{
System.out.println(a+b)
} => body of the method that contains the java statements

add (int a, int b) = This part with the name of the method and its parameter is called signature of a method
void add (int a, int b) => header of the method
=================================================================================
Types of Variables in Java:
* Always use local variables if possible
1)Local Variable: inside the method or a part of its parameters or a loop or switch statement
2)Instance Variable: inside the class, but outside any block of code, like method, loop, switch statement, if else condition
    ex: The car attributes we created
3)Static Variable: If an instance variable has "static" keyword used to create the variable

Why we learn about different types of Variables:
1) It helps us reduce the amount of RAM that our application will be using when it will be running
2) With the help of these variables, we can pass information btwn methods of class
3) They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. As soon as your method is done
    executing, they are destroyed by a special program called garbage collector

How to use these:
    Local: create inside block of code

    Pros vs Cons
Local Variables:
    Pros:They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time.
         Always try to use local variables when possible to save memory.
    Cons:Very limited scope. Cannot access outside of the block of code

Instance Variables:
    Pros: Have broader scope as compared to local variables, which means we can access in all the methods of that class
    Cons: They occupy the space in your RAM for longer periods of time

Static Variables:
    Pros: We can call static variables without creating an object of a class
         We can share a single value between all the objects of a class
