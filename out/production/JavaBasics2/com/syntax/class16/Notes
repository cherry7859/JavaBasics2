There are three types of variables in Java: Local, Instance, Static
Local Variables:
    The variables are created inside a block of code
    Method level variables
        ex: Method, loop switch statement, if else condition, constructor
    Advantages:
        We should always prefer local variables to instance or static variables
        Live for shortest period of time inside your RAM (saves memory)
    Disadvantages:
        They can't be access outside the block of code in which they are created
EXAMPLE:
    Class Countries{
        void USA() {
           String person = "Cherylle";
           }
         void Russia {
            System.out.println(person) // we will get an error b/c person is only accessible in the USA method

Instance Variables:
    They are created inside the class, but outside of a block of code
    Object/Instance level variables
    Use when want to share variable across a class. ex: dog1.color, dog2.color, dog3.color
    Advantages:
        Accessible everywhere in a class in all the blocks of code that are inside the class, but not in a static method
    Disadvantages:
        They keep on occupying the memory for longer periods of time
        Separate memory location created for each variable

Static Variables:
    When we have an instance variable with a static keyword
    Class level variables
    Use when you know all of the objects of a class will remain the same. ex: noOfDogLegs = 4;
    Use when want to share a variable across different objects/instances. ex: NoOfEmployees = 500;
    Advantages:
        They have highest scope available, even outside of an object
        B/C class level variables, does not matter how many objects we create from that class only one variable is created
    Disadvantages:
        Occupy the memory for longest period of time
        Can hold only a single value for all the objects
