Variables:
    - Basic unit to store data
    - It's easy to access the value by variable name, don't have to deal with indexes
Problems with variables:
    - They can only store one value at a time
    - If have to store more than one value, have to declare more variables

Arrays:
    - Can hold multiple values in a single variable, then use indexes to access those values
Benefits of Arrays:
    - Fastest data structure when processing the data
    - Occupy 4 times less memory than an ArrayList
Problems with Arrays:
    - Fixed in size; once created, can't modify its size
    - No built-in methods in arrays like: add, remove, findIndex etc.

ArrayList:
