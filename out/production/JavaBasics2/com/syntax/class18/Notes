What is a Constructor in Java:
    A Constructor is a special block of code that helps us give initial value of a class. Initialization if object or instance
Why we should use a Constructor:
    1) When we use the constructor to initialize the object, it looks more readable and cleaner
    2) If the fields of a class are private, its not possible to access them outside the class without
        constructor or a method. Which means we can't initialize them without a method or constructor
    3) We can enforce rules, like what kind of values are assigned to variables with the help of a constructor
    4) If we want to make sure that some lines of code should always be executed when the object of a class is created,
        we can put that code inside the constructor
How to Use Constructor:
    We create constructors inside the class and when an object of that class is created, the constructor is executed automatically
    Ex:
        class Car{
        String make;
        String model;

        Car(String carMake,String carModel){ // These lines of code are the constructor
        make = carMake;
        model = carModel;
        }

        public static void main(String[] args){
        Car bmw = new Car("BMW","m4"); //When the object is created, the constructor is applied
        }
        }

    Rules:
        1) Constructors don't have return types, not even void(B/C they actually create the object
        2) The name of the constructor should always be same as name of the class
        3) Constructors can't be created with a static keyword
        4) We can use any access modifiers with Constructors
        5) If we don't create a constructor in a class, a default constructor with zero parameters is
            created by compiler (Takes a code written by us, and it converts that code to byte code which is easier for Java to understand)
        6) Can have multiple constructors in one Class, but each must have different number of parameters
    This Keyword:
        We can use the "this" keyword to access the instance variables when we have same name variables in your
        method or constructor or any block of code
        Ex:
            this(): This way is not that common
            Calls the constructors of a class inside other constructors
            We should use it b/c it helps use reuse always written constructors if they contain same code
            We create multiple constructors b/c we want to give end user flexibility that he can create
                the objects of our class in many different ways
