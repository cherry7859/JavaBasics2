What is WebElement?
- anything we see on the webpage (buttons, text boxes, checkboxes, links)

HTML?
HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
Document Object Model. It is the browser's internal view of the webpage
Also called as Dev tools
Document --> a simple html document which represents the page we are inspecting
Object --> any new line in HTML is considered to be an object
Model --> a layout/blueprint of the HTML

Locator:
- An address/position of a web element on the webpage
- Used to locate or identify web elements on the webpage

8 Locators:
- ID
    - always look for this first b/c usually unique
     - Try not to use if have numeric values b/c are usually dynamic/changes
- Name
- TagName
- Xpath
- LinkText
- PartialLinkText
- CssSelectors
- ClassName

Why do we need so many locators?
- Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
- Some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
- Some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
e.g linkText and partialLinkText are only used for links

"a" tag is also called an anchor tag (used to indicate a link)

If 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values, Selenium will only interact w/ the first element it locates
