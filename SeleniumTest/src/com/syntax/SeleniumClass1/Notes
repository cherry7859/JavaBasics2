How many ways can we actually test?
- Manual
- Automation

When do we go for Automation Testing?
- After manual testing is passed
- When environment is stable (Testing environment)
- Analyze test suite and choose automation tools

What Automation tools do we know about?
- Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG, JUnit, Katalon Studio, UFT/QTP

Level of Testing:
- Unit testing (Developers)

    - Security: Make sure can't be hacked (CyberSecurity team)

What is Selenium?
- Set of tools which help us to automate web applications
- Mainly used to perform functional testing

Selenium Components:
- Selenium IDE: integrated development environment
- Selenium Grid: Firefox extension/plugin
- Selenium WebDriver
- Selenium RC: Use for Remote Server

What is Selenium WebDriver?
- Open source automation tool which allows us to perform actions on web applications
- Is an Interface

Advantages of Selenium WebDriver:
- Open Source
- Works with different browsers and supports cross browsing testing
- Operating System independent (iOS, Windows, Linux)
- Works with different programming languages (java, javascript, ruby, python)

Disadvantages of Selenium WebDriver:
- Cannot test desktop applications
- No technical support
- No built in reports
- Cannot test images, videos and captchas

get() vs navigate():
- navigate() can go back, forward and refresh
- get() will wait for the page to fully load, navigate() won't
- get() will not keep the history of the browser, navigate() will

close() vs quit():
- close() closes the current tab
- quit() quits the whole browser

fullscreen() vs maximize():
- maximize() will maximise the browser and you can still see the control panel (back, forward, bookmarks)
- fullscreen() will maximize the whole webpage, can't see any control panel commands
