Why do we need Xpath and CSS Selector?
    - Developers may not provide all the locators in html
    - By using Xpath and CSS we can identify elements with any given attributes

What is an Xpath?
    - like a query language which helps us to identify elements uniquely on the webpage

Types of Xpath:
    - Absolute Xpath --> starts from the starting node of the html
                       - It always starts with single slash (/)
            - cmd+f to locate the Xpath in DOM
                - ex: /html/body/div/div/div

    - Relative Xpath --> starts from any node in html
                       - It always starts with double slash (//)
           - Syntax: //tagName[@attribute = 'attribute value']
                - ex: //input[@id = 'email']

        - Identifying elements by its text:
            //tagName[text() = 'text value']
                - ex: //a[text() = 'Create new account']

        - Identifying elements by using contains method:
            //tagName[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]
              - ex: //input[contains(@placeholder, 'Email')]
             - ex: //h2[contains(text(), 'the world')]

        - Identifying elements by using starts-with method:
            //tagName[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]
             - ex: //input[starts-with(@aria-label, 'Email')]

    - Advanced Xpath --> based on parent, child, and sibling relationships
        - Use a preceding sibling to identify following element
            //tagName[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibling::siblingTagName
                -ex: //input[@id = 'calFromDate']/following-sibling::img
        - Use a following sibling to identify preceding element
            - ex: //span[text() = '& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span
        - Use a child to identify parent element
            - ex: //span[text() = '& Orders']/parent::a
        - Identify ancestor element
            - ex: //input[@id = 'email']/ancestor::form
                - Will locate the highest ancestor with ancestorTagName
        - Use index to identify element:
            - ex: (//img[@class = 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]
                - Use the index on the end to select which identical element
